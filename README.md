## IMDb Movie Search Tool

This Node.js script allows you to search for movies on IMDb and retrieve search results based on your input. It utilizes the `https` module to make a request to the IMDb website's search page and then uses the `jsdom` library for parsing and manipulating the HTML data.

### How to Use

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install jsdom
   ```

3. Run the script using the command:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

4. You will be prompted to enter the movie you want to search for.

5. The script will fetch the search results from IMDb, parse the data, and display the movie titles in the console.

Please note that web scraping should be done in accordance with the website's terms of use, and this script may need adjustments if the structure of the IMDb website changes.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this script to suit your specific needs or integrate it into your own projects.
